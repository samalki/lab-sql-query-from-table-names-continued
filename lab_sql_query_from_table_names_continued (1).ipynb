The first (old) approach provided only table names and short descriptions, while the second (new) approach followed best practices outlined in a study from Ohio University. This included using SQL CREATE TABLE statements, sample data, and few-shot learning with example queries.\n",

        "Approach\n",
        "Dataset Setup:\n",
        "\n",
        "Three tables were used in both methods:\n",
        "employees (ID, name)\n",
        "salary (ID, year, salary)\n",
        "studies (ID, user ID, education level, institution, years, specialty)\n",
        "Prompting Strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "Old Approach: Tables and attributes were described in plain text.\n",
        "New Approach:\n",
        "Used SQL CREATE TABLE statements for clarity.\n",
        "Included sample data to provide context.\n",
        "Provided few-shot learning examples to guide SQL generation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Find the highest-paid employee.\n",
        "Retrieve the university with the highest average salary.\n",
        "List employees with a master's degree who earn more than $60,000.\n",
        "Findings\n",
        "Query Accuracy & Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "The new approach consistently generated more accurate SQL queries, with correct JOIN conditions and table references.\n",
        "The old approach occasionally missed important joins or used incorrect table aliases.\n",
        "Reduction in Hallucinations:\n",
        "\n",
        "The old prompt sometimes included non-existent columns or tables, whereas the new prompt significantly reduced hallucinations by providing structured table definitions and examples.\n",
        "Handling Complex Queries:\n",
        "\n",
        "The new approach performed better with multi-table joins and aggregation queries, likely due to the example-based prompting.\n",
        "Key Learnings\n",
        "Providing SQL CREATE TABLE statements enhances query accuracy by giving GPT-3.5 a clearer database schema.\n",
        "Few-shot learning significantly improves performance, especially for complex queries.\n",
        "Reducing ambiguity in table names and relationships minimizes hallucinations.\n",
        "Context size matters—longer prompts improve results but may limit model response length.\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "By structuring prompts using SQL CREATE TABLE statements, sample data, and example queries, GPT-3.5-Turbo becomes more reliable in generating SQL queries. This approach improves accuracy, reduces errors, and minimizes hallucinations, making it a best practice for text-to-SQL applications.\n",
